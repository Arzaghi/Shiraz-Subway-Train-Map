Shiraz subway train map is my first ReactJs application which I created just for the learning purposes

To execute the application just navigate to the root directory of project using command propmt and run

1) npm install
  this command will install all dependencies
 
2) npm start
  This command will run the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

3) npm run build
  this command will produce a production build
